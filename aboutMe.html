    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>How do I spend my free time?</h2>
    <p>Most of my free time is spent either self-educating, exercising, or hanging out with friends.
        I used to do a lot more studying in my free time than I do now-a-days, but it seems that
        most of that is now dedicated to being in the company of those who I enjoy being around, friends if you will.  
        I used to play a lot of videogames, but that has been since phased out of my recent activities. </p>
    
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>The end game is of course to one day run my own company.  Let's talk a little 
        earlier than end game though, for the time being, I plan to graduate from
        University of Maryland with a Bachelors in Computer Science, ideally
        with a at least a 3.6 GPA.  Soon after that, or possibly during this time, I plan
        to get a job in software development or Web development.  After acquiring multiple bags
        of money, I will hopefully own a house with a lot of land so I can have a ton of bonfires lol.</p>
